      <p className="hidden">You make it out of the shackles, and now you are loose in your cell.  
      Among the pile of bones a huge goblin femur is cracked into a sharp weapon. 

      Outside the guard snoozes, and his keys hang jangly from his belt, just within reach. 

      In the upper corner of the cell, behind some cobwebs, a cryptic code has been scrawled in arcane mathematical symbols.</p>

      <p className="hidden">You use your strength to pierce the goblin’s chest from the back all the way out the front. He jumps up, but the bone gets stuck in the bars and the Goblin convulses and gurgles, eventually coming to sweet rest after a pitiful, pitiful life. You grab the keys and you and your companion are free in the halls of Borf’s castle.

      <p className="hidden">You use your agile fingers to silently slip the ring of keys from the slumbering goblin’s belt. For a moment you imagine the punishment this goblin will recieve for letting us go, and you don't feel sorry for him. His death would be a sweet, sweet relief from a pitiful, pitiful life.  

      You insert the key with such supple delicacy your reminded of your lost love. Your nimble fingers continue their magic and turn the key with nary a jangle. 
      You and Artemesia are free in the halls of Borf’s castle.

      <p className="hidden">Your advanced intelligence allows you to decrypt the hidden message. “Behind the fourth stone on the left lies a carved goblin bone capable of opening the door when inserted at a 16 degree angle.” 

      You uncover the bone key and your huge brain estimates the correct angle. The lock clicks open, and the sleeping giant snorts, and falls back asleep. 

      Artemesia appraises you with a newfound appreciation. He will remember this.

      <p className="hidden">You use your rugged worldliness on the simple Goblin. 
        “There is more world out there than you know,” you tell the pitiful excuse for a creature who doesn't deserve any amount of anthropomorphizing. “Just do this one weird trick, and women will fawn over your huge Goblin strength.”  
        “Tell me,” the Goblin begs and begs. The only way you’ll tell him is if he leaves the key with you.  
        “Every day you must do something you’re afraid of. Ask someone out, even if you know they'll say no. And the more you fail the more you will succeed. Now go, find your future love slave.” 

        The goblin runs off, and you use the key to open the cell door.

      You and Artemesia rush off down the hallway, and you approach the giant door which will surely lead to the Goblin King Borf’s throne room.</p>

The throne room door is ajar... should you enter the throne room or just leave?</p>

      <p className="hidden">You quietly approach the door to Borf's lair. It smells like burnt toast and soured ranch dressing. As you push the door open the hinge creaks, announcing your arrival. Borf sits upon his throne, glaring at you and Artemisia. You feel like you've been waiting your whole life for this one moment. With the lights low and the curtains open you fear you may be on the verge of just blowing it.
        You look around the room and notice your dead lover Jaime on a ritual table. Enraged, you find the strength to push forward. Borf declares he will resurrect Jaime and unleash unknown horrors upon the earth. There is literally a bucket of ranch dressing and a pile of toast nearby on the floor.
        Borf gets up from the throne and points his staff your direction. His eyes turn red with fury. He yells "Now you die!!!" You and Artemisia sense there is danger incoming and step aside just as a fireball soars past. Artemisia says "Now is our chance!" and awaits your next move. Do you launch the bucket of ranch dressing at Borf or lead the charge and attack?</p>

      Artemisia snatches up the magic staff. He turns to you and with a wry smile says "Hey, buddy. Thanks for helping me acquire the magic staff. I'm going to kill you and resurrect Jaime myself. With your undead lost lover by my side I will complete the ritual to open the doors to the underworld and unleash unknown horrors upon the earth. I'm not a goblin but I promise you I can be an excellent Goblin King!!! Now you die!"

        You gather a small fortune in treasure and light the castle on fire as you leave. Tossing Borf's glamor shot in the fire you laugh out loud. The hero's journey has many branches and you have walked the path to victory. Fortune smiles upon thee. {`<3`}</p>

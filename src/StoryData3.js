      <p className="hidden">You emerge to find a giant goblin with his pants down, getting ready to sit on your head. The goblin turns around with enraged frustration, and grabs you by the neck. You and Artemesia are carried off and thrown into a dungeon cell. 

      You are made to kneel, shackled with a rusty chain against the wall. Sharp bones of the previous inhabitant poke holes in your pants and lacerate your shins and your gluteus maximus. The guard somehow smells worse than the sewage, and is dozing off outside the cell.

      <p className="hidden">You and Artemesia emerge from the forest in full Goblin Armor and smeared with waste and dried blood, but even with the accoutrement you make a scrawny excuse for goblins. 

      An invisible cloud of stench leads you down the road to the Goblin King Borf’s Castle, erupting out of the landscape like a pimple.  
      The castle's drawbridge is down. A single goblin guard is playing checkers against himself. A fly becomes trapped in his ear wax. The goblin reaches up and pulls a few flies from his ear gunk and tosses 'em in his mouth like caramel corn. 

      Artemesia makes a sound of pain, as though he has seen something his huge brain will never let him forget. 

      The goblin looks up dumbly from his game. You must think quickly. What will you do?  
      You could run past him, but he's blocking the way.  
      You could fight him, but he looks quite strong.  
      You could hide, but unless he's really as stupid as he looks he's probably seen you.  
      You could talk to him and try to convince him you're goblins.  
      Or you could just walk by casually as if your confidence alone could fool him. 

      Artemesia’s judgmental eyes wait for your stupid decision.</p>

        “Tell me,” the Goblin begs and begs. The only way you’ll tell him is if he leaves the key with you.  
        “Every day you must do something you’re afraid of. Ask someone out, even if you know they'll say no. And the more you fail the more you will succeed. Now go, find your future love slave.”
